## Automated UFO Sightings Dataset Search

WAKE UP SHEEPLE! The extra-terrestrial menace has come to Earth and we here at 'ALIENS-R-REAL' have collected all of the eye-witness reports we could to prove it! All we need to do now is put this information online for the world to see and then the matter will finally be put to rest.

There is just one tiny problem though... our collection is too large to search through manually. Even our most dedicated followers are complaining that they are having trouble locating specific reports in this mess. Well we have a solution here...

Welcome to JavaScript Challenge. It promises to be an interesting challenge, using JavaScript, HTML, CSS and D3.js to search through a large dataset so we can make sense of the data and present the information contained in the data for planet Earth's inhabitants to know what information about extra-terrestial menace there are and to deal with. Code written created a table dynamically, based on dataset provided for the challenge. The webpage rendered from generated html will allow users to filter the table data for specific values contained in the dataset. Only pure JavaScript, HTMl, CSS and D3.js were used to design the web pages. Using filters, the user can pull specific queries from the dataset to be shown up on the page.

For Level-1, the dataset has dates for January 2010. So by entering any date in January 2010, the user is able to filter the table accordingly. Click on 'Filter table' to filter the table by the queried date from the dataset. Use refresh to return back to the complete table based on the dataset.

For Level-2, the dropdown 'Filter by Criteria' box allows user to select criteria of choice from 'Date', 'city', 'state', 'country' and 'shape', then enter the value queried in the box in the bottom and click on 'Search'. It filters the table to generate chosen column selection. Using either the 'Refresh' or 'Full Table' tabs refreshes the entire table.

Using the provided boxes allows the user to query the table for specific information contained in the dataset and generates a filtered table by finding rows that match user input. So this makes viewing the information about UFO sightings much easier, which aims to make the search experience for 'the truth' much easier.
